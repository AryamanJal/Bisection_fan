# Bisection_fan
Polymake code for visualising and computing bisection fans of polytopes. The Visualising bisection fan Jupyter notebook contains some snippets, examples and rough work of polymake code. The bis_cone.pl contains executable perl code that can be run from the command line (after opening polymake) as script("some folder/bis_cone.pl"); where you need to replace some folder with the location where bis_cone.pl was downloaded. e.g. /Dell/Downloads/bis_cone.pl and so on. The bis_cone1.txt contains the same content as bis_cone but is a text file. 

Before executing bis_cone.pl, go to line 6 and change the address from what I've written to the address of bis_cone.pl.
